              <p>An idol in Knights who is clever and sensitive but perpetually sleepy. He loves naps and can play the piano. He has a contentious relationship with his older brother and seeks to be recognized for his own merits in idol work and acting.

              <p>Sora is an idol in Switch with a unique perspective on the world around him due to his synesthesia. Due to this, he is easily overwhelmed and set apart from others, and he's always learning about how to exist with people while staying true to himself. He loves video games, and he is learning magic from his mentor Natsume Sakasaki. He endears me through his characteristic laughter and the way he experiences life so differently from other people.</p>

          <div id="desc">
            <p>Everyone's fluffy pink cutie and the leader of Pastel*Palettes. While clumsy at times, she always works hard and tries her best to be the greatest idol she can be. She's an aspirational character to me because even though she cries easily, and she's not a natural at what she does, she works to make her dream come true and to bring smiles to everyone through her performances. Some of my favorite Pastel*Palettes songs are Shuwarin‚òÜDrea~min and their cover of MOON PRIDE.</p>
