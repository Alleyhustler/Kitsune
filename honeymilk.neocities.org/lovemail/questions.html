      <h1>6/5/23 - Prompts/Answers</h1>
		    <p>Tumblr user @salsflore recently posted a list of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/salsflore/719031745781071872/80-selfship-questions-to-answer-whether-in-a?source=share" target="_top">84 questions for others to answer about their selfships</a>, so I figured I'd answer them for this page as a sort of introduction to Reimile. I'll probably do them one-by-one when I feel like it, so this'll keep getting updated until I reach some sort of conclusion.</p>
		    <b><p>1. whatâ€™s something you do to feel closer to them? fanfics, listen to songs, etc.</p></b>
			<blockquote>i write a whole lot, mostly small one-off scenes that i just want to put down in words, and i reread them just as often. i also like listening to his solo or other songs that he's in :] looking up reader insert fanfics can be fun too but thereâ€™s not a lot out there that suits my tastes ðŸ˜­</blockquote>
		    <b><p>2. how did you get introduced to your f/o and/or their media? do you like their source?</p></b>
			<blockquote>my friend started playing the new english version of ensemble stars music and i was like Ok i will do this too. i like it a lot itâ€™s fun and cute and it makes me happy :]</blockquote>
		    <b><p>3. whatâ€™s one or two things you especially like about your f/o? can be a headcanon!</p></b>
			<blockquote>i love that heâ€™s a vampire in a rock-based unit called UNDEAD but also the kindest most loving guy ever. he wouldnâ€™t be rei without his multitudes; heâ€™s so silly and sweet AND heâ€™s the demon king of the night. yet in all his forms he remains the same lovely person!</blockquote>
			  <b><p>4. whatâ€™s one or two things your f/os love about you? ( self positivity time babey )</p></b>
		  <blockquote>rei appreciates how sweet and accepting i am towards him, and i like playing with him and enabling his dramatic moments. if he told me he was going to bite me and take my blood i would just giggle about it. i also like taking care of him a lot ;_;</blockquote>
		    <b><p>5. how do you express your love to them? how do they express their love to you?</p></b>
		  <blockquote>he and i show our love in similar ways; we're both very physically affectionate and clingy, and we tend to fuss over each other. i try to make sure his needs are taken care of, whether it's carrying an umbrella for him or keeping tomato juice and supplements on hand. rei is also a very doting person by nature, so a lot of his actions are driven by love.</blockquote>
		    <b><p>6. a gift youâ€™d like to give them if you could, and something theyâ€™d give to you!</p></b>
		  <blockquote>i'd give him a weighted blanket with a cute bat pattern!! he'd love the feeling of being nicely compressed, and i think it would help him sleep better. as for him... he knows how much i like soft and cute things, so maybe he'd give me a plushie to hold and keep me company at night.</blockquote>
		    <b><p>7. what do you celebrate together? like halloween, christmas time, easter, etc.</p></b>
		  <blockquote>everything, really! rei cherishes the opportunity to celebrate all kinds of occasions. he says his favorite holiday is halloween, but he has a soft spot for christmas. new year's is also an important holiday, as rei and ritsu visit their relatives at this time. easter is when the sakumas have their yearly blood-drinking ritual too! not to mention anniversaries, whether it's the day we started dating or the day we moved in together.</blockquote>
		    <b><p><s>8. if you have a rival or nemesis f/o, why? are there any lore reasons or is it just because?</s></p></b>
		    <b><p>9. what are some uncommon headcanons you have for them?</p></b>
		  <blockquote>i'm not much of a headcanons person; i find it difficult to come up with them unless there's some basis in the canon text... but because rei's dislike is "noisy things," i sometimes wonder if things like thunderstorms are stressful for him if he's already having a difficult time. i imagine he's someone who's had to soothe himself for a lot of his life, so he never really got to be fearful of things in the way a normal child might. the fact that he was so well-read didn't do much to assuage his anxieties; it just meant he had more things to worry about.</blockquote>
