      <h1>7/16/23 - First Anniversary</h1>
        <p>Today marks one year since I started selfshipping with Rei! Being stuck at home as I am, we didn't do much today, but I wrote him a love letter and I'm happy just to be thinking of him. I may draw for such a special occasion :] It feels good to reflect on our relationship and what I love about him... Sometimes I focus on other games or characters for a bit, but I always come back to Rei. Ensemble Stars!! has meant so much to me all this time--a little more than a year! It brings me joy in so many ways, and there are songs that always give me comfort when I listen to them. Happy Reimile day!</p>
