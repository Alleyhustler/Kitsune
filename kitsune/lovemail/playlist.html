      <h1>8/8/23 - Playlist</h1>
		    <p>Here's a playlist of songs for my selfship with Rei! Roughly in a certain order. Edited: 12/30/23</p>
	  
		    <p><b>No Below</b> - Speedy Ortiz</p>
		    <i>And though I once said I was better off just being dead<br>
		    Better off just being dead, without my old friend<br>
	    	True, I once said, I was better off just being dead<br>
		    But I didn't know you yet</i>
		    
		    <p><b>Broom People</b> - The Mountain Goats</p>
		    <i>Friends who don't have a clue<br>
        Well-meaning teachers<br>
        But down in your arms, in your arms<br>
        I am a wild creature</i>
	  
	    	<p><b>I Hear a Symphony</b> - Cody Fry</p>
		    <i>With simple songs I wanted more<br>
	    	Perfection is so quick to bore<br>
	    	You are more beautiful by far<br>
	    	Our flaws are who we really are</i>
		
        <p><b>Fresh Static Snow</b> - Porter Robinson</p>
		    <i>You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness<br>
	     	Melt this curse away<br>
	    	Though I'll never know your name<br>
	     	I'll cry for you the same</i>
	  
	  	  <p><b>One Caress</b> - Depeche Mode</p>
	    	<i>I'm shying from the light<br>
	    	I always loved the night<br>
	    	And now you offer me<br>
	    	Eternal darkness</i>
	  
		    <p><b>The Light Behind Your Eyes</b> - My Chemical Romance</p>
		    <i>If I could be with you tonight<br>
	    	I would sing you to sleep<br>
	    	Never let them take the light behind your eyes</i>
	  
	    	<p><b>Tell Me It's Okay (Demo)</b> - Paramore</p>
	    	<i>Maybe it's been years since I genuinely smiled<br>
	    	And maybe it's been years since I wanted to be a part of anything<br>
	    	But lately I've been good, you know, I've actually been great<br>
	    	Man, I even laughed a little today, oh, so strange, so strange</i>
		
		    <p><b>All Things End</b> - Hozier</p>
		    <i>All that we intend is scrawled in sand<br>
	    	And slips right through our hands<br>
	    	And just knowing<br>
	    	That everything will end<br>
	    	Should not change our plans<br>
	    	When we begin again</i>
		
	    	<p><b>Life Eternal</b> - Ghost</p>
	    	<i>Can you hear me say your name–forever?<br>
	    	Can you see me longing for you–forever, forever?<br>
	    	Would you let me touch your soul–forever?<br>
	    	Can you feel me longing for you–forever and ever?</i>
		
		    <p><b>Bonus:</b></p>
		
		    <p><b>Yumekui Shirokuro Baku</b> - Nem<a href="https://vocaloidlyrics.fandom.com/wiki/夢喰い白黒バク_(Yumekui_Shirokuro_Baku)">*</a></p>
	    	<i>Did you have a scary dream? Leave it to me.<br>
	    	I’ll eat it up completely<br>
	    	No more worries; rest in peace.<br>
	    	Forget all those terrible things.<br><br>
		
		    Does this lady<br>
	    	Say she has another favor to ask of me?<br>
	    	I won’t refuse<br>
	    	Since this is what makes me truly happy<br>
	    	…In that case, let’s make a promise with a kiss</i>
